(* ** GraphTree

A [GraphTree] is a data structure which is used to represent a set of
  graphs that are mostly similar, but with a few small differences.  For
  example, suppose we want to represent two graphs: one which adds an edge e1
  to a graph G, and another which adds a different edge e2 to G.  Rather than
  representing these as {G + e1, G + e2}, a [GraphTree] would represent them
  as G + {e1 or e2}.

  The motivation for a [GraphTree] is to more easily represent the case in
  which, for example, a litmus test outcome may be observable in any one of
  a number of possible graphs, some of which will generally look very similar.
